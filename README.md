Approval Workflow:
                  Managers can approve or reject expenses.

                  If rejected, the rejection reason is logged in the chatter.

Automated Email Notifications:
                              When an employee submits an expense, an email is sent to the relevant manager for approval.

                              If approved, an email with a link to the relevant expense is sent to finance users based on their access security.
                              
                              Clicking the "Create Payment" button opens a popup with prefilled details from the expense.

                              On saving, the payment ID is linked to the expense, and the expense ID is linked to the payment, ensuring proper tracking.
